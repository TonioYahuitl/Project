      The countries involed in the D-day attack were the American, British, and canadian soldiers.<br>
      The D-day attck was one of the largest amphibious assault that happened on June 6, 1944. So there is a lot talk about that <br>
      happened in the assault. The topic that I'm going to focus on that happen in the assault is the paratrooper <br>
      attacks that happened before the land invasion. They planned the paratrooper attack to help weaken the <br>
      the front beaches to give the land assault a better chance of winning. The airborne divisions that were involved <br>
      in paratrooper assault were 101st, 82nd, and several of the british 6th airbourne division. The division had different <br>
      task they had to accomplish the 101st division had to capture the western UTAH.The 82nd task was to destroy the bridges <br>
      and halt a advanced from the west. Another task they had was take over the town of St. Mere Egles and to secure key <br>
      approaches to the allie backheads.<br>
<br>
      <br>
      Although this was all planned out as soon as they started to attack things were not going right paratroopers were either blown far off their marks, swamped in man-made <br>
      lagoons or easy prey for snipers as they drifted toward the ground. Stormy seas made for rough beach landings, sometimes far off-course <br>
      about 23,000 allied troops dropped by parachute or glider. They were carried into the air by Douglas C-47 Dakota aircraft about 127 of the aircrafts <br>
      were lost. Paratoopers carried up to 200 pounds of equipment many of them drowned in inland marshes flooded by Nazi engineer. Even though they were <br>
      having a hard time several paratrooper division were able to carry out thier missions by destroying strategic bridge and silencing some German gun batteriers.<br>
      at end the allies gain the advantage and ended pushing back the Nazi Germans soldiers and taking over Normandy everybody involed had a big part in this and they did <br>
      what needed to be done to turn this war around.
    </p>
    <h2>HOW DID IT IMPACT THE WAR?</h2>

    <p style="color:white">
This impacted the war because this was the turning point of the war in european theater because winning the this attack gave the allies <br>
a huge step into stopping Hitler and his Nazi Germany soldiers. This ended up leading up to the end of the war in the Europen theater.
    </p>
    <h2>WHY THIS IS IMPORTANT TO LEARN ABOUT?</h2>

    <p style="color:white">
      This event is very important because when learning about WW2 this a topic we looked at a lot because it was the evet that turned the war around for the allies. Also because <br>
      it the largest amphibious assaults that happened in WW2 so when researching it or learning about it there a lot things you can talk about and research about because a lot <br>
      of things happened in this event that you can talk about.
    </p>



    <h2>WHY I CHOOSE THIS TOPIC?</h2>
    <p style="color:white">
The reason I choose this topic was because I wanted to write about something that we didn't really focus on which was the paratroopers I found them to be intresting <br>
because they were the first to attack and gave the allie a big advantage to take over Normandy, France. Many different airbourne divisions were apart this that didn't know <br>
about. As soon as I started reearching about I started learn new things about how paratroopers were a big part of the and many of them sacerficed their lifes to push back <br>
Nazi German soldiers.
